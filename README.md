# DegreeProject
Using artificial neural networks to transcribe chords over time and find the key from an audio recording.

Goals for the project:
- Segmented fast fourier transforms (spectrograms) on audio
- Categorization neural network on spectrograms to find notes
- Categorization neural network on notes to find key
- Algorithm to label chords in song according to key

Breaking this down we start with chords, or combinations of notes. Musicians often use multiple notes at once when writing music, this concept is known as polyphany,
and these combinations of notes are called chords. The chords over the course of a song will typically define a progression through a scale (a set of notes which are
known to sound good together). *Important to note*, is that scales are subjective in nature, and often when multiple scales can be chosen the choice is based on 
readability for the musician. Scales and notes are denoted by the letters A to G, and the set of notes represent a set of pitches defined by a logarithmic equation.

Our goal is to use fast fourier transforms to generate a spectrogram (an amplitude of pitch over time graph), discretize this spectrogram so that each unit represents 
a note, use a classification AI that can recognize which notes are being played, use a classification AI that can determine the key, and then use a classification
algorithm for naming chords given the key generated by the AI.
